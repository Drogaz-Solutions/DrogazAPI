# DrogazAPI
Hypixel Skyblock API made by Drogaz#6521, feel free to share improvements.

This project requires: [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 7.4 and a Web & SQL Server.

I also strongly advice using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the API.

# Setup - This API is currently not functional.


1. Clone the repository & move it into your server.

2. Open terminal and use ``composer install`` (Dont use composer update or files can corrupt)

3. Use ``php artisan serve`` and your ready to use.
